"""Background poller for new production Sentry issues.

When a new issue appears, fires an async callback so the wrapper can open a
Slack thread and run a Claude turn that triages it (the `sentry-triage` skill
in the btdash checkout does the investigation and any Jira filing). Polls the
Sentry REST API directly with a read-only token from
``~/.bizzybot/settings.env`` (``SENTRY_API_TOKEN``); credentialed polling
lives in the agent-wrapper for the same reason the PR poller's does:
Central-Dispatch holds no Sentry credential.

Unlike the PR poller's seen-map, dedup here is a ledger persisted to
``~/.bizzybot/sentry-watch-ledger.json``. A reviewed PR drops out of GitHub's
search results, so in-memory state suffices there; a Sentry issue stays
unresolved for weeks, so unpersisted state would re-fire the whole backlog on
every restart and seed-on-start would permanently skip anything open at that
moment. The ledger gives each issue a phase:

  * ``announced`` — a Slack thread was opened; the triage turn may or may not
    have completed. Re-offered once on the first poll after startup (a
    duplicate announce after a crash is acceptable; a silently lost
    investigation is not) — never on later polls, so a persistently failing
    dispatch cannot re-announce every interval.
  * ``retry`` — dispatch failed before or during the turn; retried on later
    polls until MAX_TRIAGE_ATTEMPTS is spent.
  * ``failed`` — MAX_TRIAGE_ATTEMPTS dispatches failed. Logged loudly, never
    auto-fired again; a human triages it by hand.
  * ``completed`` — the triage turn ran to the end, or the entry was seeded.
    Pruned once the issue leaves the unresolved set, so a resolve-then-regress
    cycle fires as new; an issue that regresses while still unresolved re-fires
    via the ``fired_substatus`` memory, cleared when it is next seen healthy.
  * ``listed`` — surfaced in a storm rollup but not auto-triaged; a human
    triages it by hand from the rollup checklist. Never auto-fired again,
    including on regression.
